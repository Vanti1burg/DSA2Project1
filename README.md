# DSA2Project1
Repository for project 1  in DSAII
I am not familiar with how to write readme's for documentation however I'll take this oportunity to explain the way in which to use this program
step 1: Load this folder into a linux environment
step 2: Navigating into the directory with the terminal once inside you can run the "make main" command to generate the executables for the program to run
step 3: simply type into the terminal "./main" to run the program, this is a hands off program that only requires you to start it as it will finsh on its own

Warning: this program generates .txt files and so the number of files you start and end with may not be the same.s
